# Donation Campaign Project Features


- __*Create*__ a search feature that allows users to search for specific donation categories and retrieve relevant data.
- __*Enable*__ data persistence by storing donation information, including the category, in the browser's local storage. This allows users to revisit the campaign page and see their previous donations also show the details on UI.
- __*Created*__ a pie chart that visually represents the progress of donations for two specific categories: "Donations Needed" and "Donations Received."
